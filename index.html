Mayflower has no captain and no crew, and is a scientific research vessel for gathering data from the ocean to help us understand the impact of climate change and pollution, studying things like microplastics and the health of marine mammals. This fully autonomous boat is scheduled to sail from Plymouth UK to Plymouth Massachusetts, recreating the journey of the Pilgrim Fathers just over 400 years ago. Andy will describe how the AI Captain navigates the ship and talks about some of the scientific experiments on board, and the data these are producing.">

                    <p>Prof Andy Stanford-Clark leads transformational innovation projects for clients in EMEA as part of IBM's Corporate Strategy organisation. He is an IBM Distinguished Engineer, a Master Inventor with more than 40 patents, and is IBM's Quantum Computing leader for the UK. Andy is based at IBM's Hursley Park laboratories near Winchester, and has has been working in the area that we now call the Internet of Things for more than 20 years. He has a BSc in Computing and Mathematics, and a PhD in Computer Science. He is a Visiting Professor at the University of Newcastle, an Honorary Professor at the University of East Anglia, an Adjunct Professor at the University of Southampton, and a Fellow of the British Computer Society.</p>

Attackers have seized the advantage with the democratization of AI and the ubiquitous availability of computing resources via third party service providers while defenders endeavor to keep pace. The recent Presidential Executive Order on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity from the current US administration significantly raises the bar on security on both government and commercial IT service providers creating a unique opportunity to infuse new security architectures and technologies into enterprise defenses. The time is ripe for harvesting decades long work in systems security research to implement and deploy confidential computing mechanisms to lay the foundation for zero trust architectures and secure enterprise and cloud environments. In this talk, we will describe the drivers and evolution of both compute-centric and data-centric confidential computing mechansims that were pioneered at IBM Research and discuss the important problems that remain to be solved to realize the promise of these technologies and bring change across the industry.">

               <h4>Josyula R. Rao</h4>
               <p>J.R. Rao is an IBM Fellow and CTO for the Security Research team at IBM. Based at the IBM Thomas. J. Watson Research Center, the global team comprises more than 200 researchers who work in the areas of AI Security, Cybersecurity, Cloud and Systems Security, Information Security and Cryptography. JR works closely with commercial and government customers, academic partners and IBM business units to drive new and innovative technologies into IBM's products and services and definitive industry standards. The goal of his research is to significantly raise the bar on the quality of security while simultaneously easing the overhead of developing and deploying secure solutions. Dr. Rao has published widely in premier security conferences and workshops and holds numerous US and European patents. He is a member of the IBM Academy of Technology, emeritus member of IFIP's Working Group 2.3 (Programming Methodology) and the Industry Advisory Board of the Georgia Tech Information Security Center. Dr. Rao obtained his doctorate degree from the University of Texas at Austin, a Master’s degree in Computer Science from the State University of New York at Stony Brook, and a Bachelor of Technology degree in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur.</p>

In this talk, I will show how we can use concepts behind classic AP to design an entirely CMOS-based, general-purpose microarchitecture that can deliver manifold speedups while remaining highly programmable. The inherent data-level parallelism, flexibility, and search/update primitives of AP make associative processors promising candidates for database analytics accelerators. I will briefly touch on a co-designed hardware/software prototype system for database analytics. Overall, our experiments show that our associative processor designs accelerate general-purpose applications by 14 (up to 254) and database analytics by 11 (up to 61) times, on average, compared to an iso-area traditional out-of-order superscalar core.  One core lesson from these two experiences is that innovation comes from new paradigms, which change the ways we build both the hardware and the software. In this Cambrian era of accelerators, where we strive for generality and efficiency, typically two opposing forces, what will be the next computing paradigm for data-intensive problems?"> Rethinking Associative Processing for Modern Systems <br> Helena Caminal (Cornell University) </td>

Due to their size, complexity, and heterogeneity, these systems are difficult to design and verify, especially for small teams. In this talk, I will present ESP, an open-source platform for SoC design, developed over the course of a decade of research and teaching at Columbia University, to address this challenge. I will discuss two important use cases of ESP. First, I will demonstrate ESP’s productivity gains in SoC design, as evidenced by the ASIC implementation of two domain-specific SoCs in the last two years. The two SoCs have increasing complexity, yet were both designed by less than 10 engineers in the span of just a few months. Second, I will show how ESP can be used as a valuable tool for computer architecture research to enable full-system evaluation of novel ideas. This potential is demonstrated by our recent work Cohmeleon, in which we applied reinforcement learning to dynamically select the best coherence mode for accelerators at runtime based on the status of the SoC."> Agile Design, Optimization, and Test of Domain-Specific Systems-on-Chip <br> Joseph Zuckerman (Columbia University) </td>

Quantum information can be protected by using Quantum Error Correction (QEC) codes but requires huge redundancy which may be impractical on Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) systems with few hundreds of qubits. Instead, NISQ systems execute programs in the presence of noise and are simultaneously used to study QEC so that large fault-tolerant quantum computers can be built in future.In this talk, I will offer an overview of some of my recent works on software techniques to mitigate errors in NISQ systems and describe some architecture solutions for fault-tolerant quantum systems. I will describe LILLIPUT, a lightweight reconfigurable practical lookup table decoder, a logic that identifies errors in real-time, for small QEC codes. I will also discuss the AFS decoder that focuses on the system level architecture and organization of decoders in large fault-tolerant systems.

Besides just having secure software, it is important that the hardware itself in these devices is exploit free, which requires careful attention to security throughout the computing pipeline. Works that consider two of the stages will be discussed here. The first presents a more robust hardware trojan detection framework, to flag modifications or additions to an intended design added at an untrusted foundry. Using a combination of a novel spatially resolved sensing method and convolutional neural networks to perform unbiased and automated detection, this method can achieve higher sensitivity compared to prior methods. Furthermore, with the rise of edge devices and novel computing schemes such as analog and in-memory compute, the data processed by the hardware does not live entirely in the digital domain, where security methods have been more established. Thus, the second work presents a side channel secure analog to digital converter that utilizes a randomized conversion process to reduce leakage to eavesdroppers measuring electromagnetic or power signals.
