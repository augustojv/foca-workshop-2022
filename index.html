Confidential Computing based on Zero Trust Architectures is a step towards data privacy. It shields the customer from service providers and cloud providers gaining access to customer data by encrypting all data at all times and attesting hardware and software at all levels. In this talk, I will walk the system stack ( hardware and software ) and describe the various attack points and weak spots and how confidential computing techniques are being deployed to counteract these weak spots.">

In this talk, I will show how we can use concepts behind classic AP to design an entirely CMOS-based, general-purpose microarchitecture that can deliver manifold speedups while remaining highly programmable. The inherent data-level parallelism, flexibility, and search/update primitives of AP make associative processors promising candidates for database analytics accelerators. I will briefly touch on a co-designed hardware/software prototype system for database analytics. Overall, our experiments show that our associative processor designs accelerate general-purpose applications by 14 (up to 254) and database analytics by 11 (up to 61) times, on average, compared to an iso-area traditional out-of-order superscalar core.  One core lesson from these two experiences is that innovation comes from new paradigms, which change the ways we build both the hardware and the software. In this Cambrian era of accelerators, where we strive for generality and efficiency, typically two opposing forces, what will be the next computing paradigm for data-intensive problems?"> Rethinking Associative Processing for Modern Systems <br> Helena Caminal (Cornell University) </td>

Users and providers like this trend, as applications composed of ephemeral functions can be fine-grained billed, attain  high resource utilization, and scale easily. However, current serverless environments have multiple overheads, including lengthy startup latency, costly inter-function communication and frequent function execution stalls due to RPC/HTTP invocations. To make the matter worse, these overheads accumulate across many functions composing an application. Serverless applications are organized as workflows of multiple interdependent serverless functions. Control and data dependences force a function to wait until all of its dependences are satisfied. In this talk, I will present a novel execution paradigm for serverless applications, Super Scalar Cloud, inspired by modern out-of-order processors. With this model, functions in an application are executed early, speculatively, before their control and data dependences are resolved. Control dependences are predicted with a software-based branch predictor, and data dependences are speculatively satisfied with memoization. With this support, the execution of downstream functions is overlapped with that of upstream functions, substantially reducing the end-to-end execution time of  applications. While a function is speculative, we need to prevent its buffered outputs from being evicted to global storage. Then, when the dependences are resolved, we proceed to validate the function. If no dependence violation is detected, the function commits. Otherwise,  the buffered speculative data is discarded and the offending functions are squashed and restarted. The proposed approach results in significant savings across various real-world workloads with regards to average response time, tail latency and throughput."> Super Scalar Clouds <br> Jovan Stojkovic (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign) </td>

I will discuss two important use cases of ESP. First, I will demonstrate ESP’s productivity gains in SoC design, as evidenced by the ASIC implementation of two domain-specific SoCs in the last two years. The two SoCs have increasing complexity, yet were both designed by less than 10 engineers in the span of just a few months. Second, I will show how ESP can be used as a valuable tool for computer architecture research to enable full-system evaluation of novel ideas. This potential is demonstrated by our recent work Cohmeleon, in which we applied reinforcement learning to dynamically select the best coherence mode for accelerators at runtime based on the status of the SoC."> Agile Design, Optimization, and Test of Domain-Specific Systems-on-Chip <br> Joseph Zuckerman (Columbia University) </td>

Instead, NISQ systems execute programs in the presence of noise and are simultaneously used to study QEC so that large fault-tolerant quantum computers can be built in future.In this talk, I will offer an overview of some of my recent works on software techniques to mitigate errors in NISQ systems and describe some architecture solutions for fault-tolerant quantum systems.

Many of these applications leverage heterogeneous multiprocessor consisting of multiple types of accelerators to achieve this goal. They also feature parallelism where tasks with the application can and should run concurrently to capitalize on performance. As a result, though, the system running these applications needs to support scheduling these applications on a diverse set of hardware while preserving performance. Key considerations must be given to when to schedule a task with the application, how to ensure portability of the program across various SoCs, and how to best represent and extract inherent parallelism in the application. Ideally, the applications should require no hardware-specific manual restructuring nor platform specific code. The systems should handle these details allowing applications to be written in a hardware agnostic fashion. The UIUC Compiler research team has developed a compiler called HPVM that in conjunction with IBM’s Scheduler API will create a system capable of achieve all these goals. This talk will focus on the high-level details of HPVM and Scheduler API and how they were used in a specific autonomous car application, namely IBM’s ERA application.">HPVM and Scheduler API: System for heterogenous parallel programing <br> Gauri Patwardhan (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign) </td>

Moreover, commodity kernels remain monolithic, i.e., execute core kernel subsystems in a single address space along with hundreds of dynamically loaded extensions and device drivers. Today, operating system kernels such as Linux suffer from hundreds of low level vulnerabilities every year. Lack of isolation within the kernel implies that a vulnerability in any of the kernel subsystems or device drivers opens a way to mount a successful attack on the entire kernel. Historically, isolation within the kernel remained prohibitive due to the high cost of hardware isolation primitives, however, new isolation mechanisms are being introduced by silicon vendors that are light-weight and thus changing the landscape of isolation. In this talk, I will introduce my work on a low-overhead isolation mechanism to compartmentalize kernel subsystems by leveraging an extended page-table (EPT) switching with VM functions. We define a set of invariants that allows us to isolate kernel components in the face of an intricate execution model of the kernel. Now, with performance no longer being the main roadblock, the complexity of isolating device drivers has become the main challenge. I will talk about our work on KSplit, a new framework for isolating unmodified device drivers in a modern, full-featured kernel. I will briefly talk about our work on Redleaf, a new operating system designed from scratch in Rust to showcase how we can build fine grained isolation by leveraging safe languages.

Works that consider two of the stages will be discussed here. The first presents a more robust hardware trojan detection framework, to flag modifications or additions to an intended design added at an untrusted foundry. Using a combination of a novel spatially resolved sensing method and convolutional neural networks to perform unbiased and automated detection, this method can achieve higher sensitivity compared to prior methods. Furthermore, with the rise of edge devices and novel computing schemes such as analog and in-memory compute, the data processed by the hardware does not live entirely in the digital domain, where security methods have been more established.
